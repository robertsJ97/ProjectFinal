    I'm going to commend you for this. You're about to take on the hardest of my trials. At least, you'll attempt to. You've got from numbers 1-500 to choose from. Can you pick the right one, fearless genius?

    I really don't think you can do this. 500 numbers, and only one is the correct solution. You'd have more fun trying to win the lottery while being struck by lightning. Well, it'd be more entertaining.
